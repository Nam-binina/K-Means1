# K means

This project is a test to better understand the **K-Means algorithm**.

We will implement it in Python in two stages:

1. **Manual Implementation**: First, we will try to implement the algorithm from scratch without using any libraries that already provide it.  
2. **Scikit-Learn Implementation**: Then, we will use **Scikit-Learn** to implement K-Means and compare the results with our manual implementation.

The goal is to deepen our understanding of how K-Means works under the hood before using built-in tools.
